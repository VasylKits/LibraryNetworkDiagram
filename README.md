Overview of the Schema
This schema supports a network of libraries that store books. Each book may have multiple copies, allowing the system to track individual book copies, 
which can be transferred between libraries or loaned out to readers. 
When a reader places a loan request, they can borrow multiple copies of books from a specific library. 
Librarians process these requests, and the system tracks all necessary information about the lending process.

This structure ensures that all aspects of book management are covered: from storage and categorization to author management and loan processing. Each table in the schema plays a specific role to maintain the integrity of library operations.
